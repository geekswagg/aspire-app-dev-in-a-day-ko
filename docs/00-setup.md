1. Run the command below in a terminal in your GitHub codespace to see the location of your current repository.
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
   When you run this command, you should get something like this: If you see 'Azure-Samples' in 'origin', you'll need to recreate the codespace in your own repository.
    ```bash
    origin  https://github.com/<Your GitHub ID>/aspire-app-dev-in-a-day-ko (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/<Your GitHub ID>/aspire-app-dev-in-a-day-ko (push)
    upstream        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aspire-app-dev-in-a-day-ko.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aspire-app-dev-in-a-day-ko.git (push)
    ```
